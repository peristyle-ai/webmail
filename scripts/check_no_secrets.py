"""Fail the build if a secret is committed.

GitHub's own secret scanning and push protection are free on PUBLIC
repositories. On a private repository they need GitHub Advanced Security,
which is a paid add-on -- so until this repo is public, this script is
the enforcement.

It scans BOTH:

  1. the working tree -- every file tracked at HEAD;
  2. every blob in every commit -- so a secret that was committed and
     then deleted is still found. (GitHub's secret scanning does the
     same thing, and it is the reason a "fix the leak and move on"
     commit is not enough.)

A scanner that scanned 0 objects must report INCONCLUSIVE, never
CLEAN, and must exit non-zero. Silence is not a pass.

Exit codes:
  0  no secret found
  1  a secret was found
  2  INCONCLUSIVE -- nothing could be scanned. That is a failure too:
     a gate that cannot see is not a gate.
